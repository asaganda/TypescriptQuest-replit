You are an expert React + TypeScript + Supabase developer. Build a web application that is a gamified learning platform to teach TypeScript in React.

Tech stack:
- Frontend: React + TypeScript (you can use Vite with TS)
- Backend: Supabase (auth + Postgres DB)
- Styling: simple, clean, responsive UI (you can use basic CSS or a simple utility framework)

Core requirements:

1. Authentication & user profile
- Email + password signup/login using Supabase auth.
- Store a user profile row for each user (id, email, displayName, createdAt).
- Protect the main app so only logged-in users can access the learning content.

2. Levels, lessons, and challenges
- Data model in Supabase for:
  - levels (id, name, description, order)
  - lessons (id, levelId, title, shortDescription, content, order)
  - challenges (id, lessonId, type, prompt, starterCode, solutionCode, order)
- Seed the database (or hardcode temporarily) with a few example levels:
  - Level 1: basic types, interfaces
  - Level 2: functions, generics
  - Level 3: React + TypeScript basics (typed props, state)
- Each lesson should show some explanation text plus at least one challenge.

3. Gamification & progress tracking
- For each user, track:
  - which lessons they’ve completed
  - which challenges they’ve completed
  - total XP
  - current level unlocked
- Add a simple scoring system:
  - Completing a lesson: +20 XP
  - Completing a challenge: +30 XP
- When a user reaches certain XP thresholds, unlock the next level.
- Show a progress bar for the current level and total XP on a “Dashboard” page.
- Add a simple “badge” concept:
  - Example badges like “Completed First Lesson”, “No Hints Used” (can just be boolean flags in the DB or derived).

4. Challenge types
- Support at least two types of challenges:
  - Multiple-choice quiz (question, 4 options, correct answer).
  - Code challenge with a small in-browser code editor (it can be a basic textarea instead of a full editor if simpler).
- For multiple-choice:
  - Show feedback immediately (correct/incorrect).
- For code challenges:
  - Simulate validation by checking if the user’s answer contains certain substrings (e.g., “interface”, “type”, or certain function name) rather than running arbitrary code.

5. UI structure
- Main layout with:
  - Top navigation (App name, Dashboard, Levels, Profile, Logout).
- Pages:
  - Auth page (login/signup).
  - Dashboard: show XP, level progress, number of lessons/challenges completed, badges.
  - Levels page: list all levels with lock/unlock status and completion percentage.
  - Lesson detail page: lesson content + its challenges + progress state.
  - Profile page: basic user info and stats.

6. Implementation details
- Use Supabase client on the frontend for auth and data.
- Create clear React components for:
  - Auth forms
  - Dashboard
  - Levels list
  - Lesson/challenge views
  - Multiple-choice challenge UI
  - Code challenge UI
- Use TypeScript interfaces/types for:
  - UserProfile
  - Level
  - Lesson
  - Challenge
  - UserProgress
- Include basic error handling and loading states.

Please:
- Generate the full project structure.
- Include example seed data for at least 2–3 levels, a few lessons, and several challenges.
- Add comments explaining key parts of the code and how to extend the app later with more levels and more advanced features (like daily streaks or leaderboards).
